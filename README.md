`If you find any errors or got ideas for something new, please start an issue. Either we do it or you do it yourself`

Collaboration of random students working on calculators or algorythms for a math project.
Main cause is to learn JavaScript and have fun doing some stuff.

We want to bring in as many calculators as possible into this.
Either you hope we aren't to stupid to implement it or you fork it, implement it and become one of the random students working on it.

### How to start
- Start and test the app with `yarn start` or `npm start`
- You can view it in your Browser (http://localhost:3000)
- If you have any issues starting with npm -> Try installing yarn `npm i --global yarn`

### Status
- Algebra (EEA, Eulerische Phi Funktion, Ordnung finden)
- Graphen (Gale-Shapley)
- Kombinatorik (Pn,k Rechner| Sn,k Rechner)
- DARK MODE!!! (Based on your System settings) (maybe a pinguin button to change it will be implemented)

### In Progress
- More features for "Graphen"
- More for "Kombinatorik"
- Testing everything
- Localisation
