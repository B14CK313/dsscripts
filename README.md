# DS Skripte

Collaboration of random students working on calculators or algorythms for a math project.
Main cause is to learn JavaScript and have fun doing some stuff.
If you find any errors or got some improvement tipps pls notify "g4bri3lDev".

We want to bring in as many calculators as possible into this.
If you have any suggestions on what is missing or what could be implemented you can always start a new issue.
Either you hope we aren't to stupid to implement it or you fork it, implement it and become one of the random students working on it.

### How to start
- Start and test the app with `yarn start` or `npm start`
- You can view it in your Browser (http://localhost:3000)
- The page will reload if you make edits.\
- You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Status
- Algebra (EEA, Eulerische Phi Funktion, Ordnung finden)
- Graphen (Gale-Shapley)
- Kombinatorik (Pn,k Rechner)

### In Progress
- More features for "Graphen"
- Testing everything
- Dark Mode
- Localisation
